# densenet121-xray

This notebook compares three fine-tuning strategies for medical image classification. Starting with a frozen pretrained DenseNet121, I progressively increased model adaptation through selective layer unfreezing and class weighting. The balanced approach achieved the best generalization, demonstrating the importance of careful hyperparameter tuning in transfer learning.
